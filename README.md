# Tagless Final - Design pattern

1. Create DSLs - ‘DSLs are sets of functions that are designed specifically for solving problems in a given area’
2. Write an interpreter for a specific F - ‘Is the implementation of the DSL’
3. OPTIONAL - create some utility functions so that you don’t have to use the interpreter directly
